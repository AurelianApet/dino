W: 2.07M - 6.8 ft.	33 pounds (15 kg)	MEAT & SMALL ANIMAL	Cretaceous 75-71 Million years	• The meaning of its name is 'quick plunderer'. • Velociraptor had huge claws on their back legs. •Velociraptor (commonly shortened to "raptor") is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the Jurassic Park motion picture series. •Fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than Velociraptor are known to have had feathers covering their bodies and fully developed feathered wings •Today, Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen described fossil skeletons, the most of any dromaeosaurid.
SPINOSAURUS [THE LARGEST CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR]	H: 4.5-6 m - 15-20 ft.	W: 12.6-18 m - 41-59 ft.	7-23 tones (7,000 - 23,000 kg)	FISH & MEAT	Cretaceous 112-97  Million years	• Spinosaurus lived around 100 million years ago in what is now North Africa. • Spinosaurus means ‘spine lizard’. • Their fossils were first found in Egypt around 1910. • Spinosaurus were larger than the Tyrannosaurus Rex and may have been the largest carnivorous (meat eating) dinosaur ever. • Spinosaurus featured distinctive spines, which grew over 1.5 meters (5 feet) long. • Spinosaurus had a long, thin skull. • While Spinosaurus usually walked on two legs, studies suggest that it may have occasionally crouched on all four.
BRACHIOSAURUS [ARM LIZARD]	H: 12-16 m - 40-50 ft.	W: 12.6-18 m - 41-59 ft.	33 -88 tones (33,000-38,000 kg)	Coniferous trees	Jurassic period 156-145 Million years  Million years	• Brachiosaurus comes from Greek words meaning ‘arm’ and ‘lizard’. The name refers to the interesting nature of Brachiosaurus legs, which were longer at the front than the back. • Brachiosaurus lived in North America. • The first fossils were found in the Colorado River of the United States of America in 1900. Elmer Riggs first described the giant dinosaur in 1903, calling it “the largest known dinosaur”.  • They had a long neck, a small head and a relatively short tail compared to other Sauropods. • The Brachiosaurus walked on all four legs. • It is estimated that Brachiosaurus ate between 200 and 400 kilograms (440 and 880 pounds) of plants every day. • It wasn’t until 1994 that the original Brachiosaurus fossils found by Elmer Riggs were shown in a museum. • An asteroid found in the main asteroid belt of the Solar System was named after the Brachiosaurus.
APATOSAURUS [DECEPTIVE LIZARD]	H: 4.6 m - 15 ft.	W: 21-27 m - 70-90 ft.	33-38 tonnes (33,000-38,000 kg)	Low-lying Plants	Jurassic period 154-150 Million years	• According to studies, it took an Apatosaurus only around 10 years to reach its full size. • Apatosaurus had long whip-like tails that counter balanced their long necks. • Apatosaurus was a plant-eating (herbivore) dinosaur. • Apatosaurus was represented in the popular Transformers toy line and animated series as Sludge, an Autobot that could transform into an Apatosaurus form.
TRANNOSAURUS REX [KING OF DINOSAURS]	H: 4 m-13 ft.	W: 12.3 m-40 ft.	10.2 tones (1,0200 KG)	MEAT	Mesozoic 67-65  Million years	• ‘Tyrannosaurus’ comes from the Greek words meaning ‘tyrant lizard’, while the word ‘rex’ means ‘king’ in Latin. • Tyrannosaurus rex lived in an area of the Earth that now makes up western North America. • Tyrannosaurus rex walked on two legs, balancing its huge head with a long and heavy tail that sometimes contained over 40 vertebrae. • The skull of a Tyrannosaurus rex alone measured up to 1.5m (5ft) long. • The largest tooth of any carnivorous dinosaur found to this date is that of a T-Rex. It is estimated to have been around 30cm (12in) long when including the root. • When Tyrannosaurus rex hit around the age of 14 its body size would increase rapidly, putting on around 600kg (1300lb) a year over the next 4 years. • Tyrannosaurus rex had small arms that were extremely powerful and featured two clawed fingers.
TRICERATOPS [Three-horned dinosaur]	H: 2.8-3 m - 9.5-9.8 ft.	W: 8 m - 30 ft.	6-12 Tones (5,909- 11,818 kg)	Shrubs & plant life	Cretaceous 68-65 Million years	• The skull of a Triceratops alone could grow over 2m (7ft) in length. • The first known fossils to be that of a Triceratops were horns attached to a partial skull, found near Denver, Colorado in 1887. • Triceratops had anywhere between 400 and 800 teeth, although only a small  percentage of these were in use at any one time as they were constantly replaced  throughout its lifetime. • Triceratops was represented in the popular Transformers toy line and animated series as Slag, an Autobot that could transform into a Triceratops form.
STEGOSAURUS [Roofed lizard]	H: 2.75 m - 9 ft.	W: 8-9 m - 26-30 ft.	2.4 Tones (2400.kg)	Low lying bushes	Jurassic period 155-150 Million years	• The Stegosaurus is the most famous dinosaur from a group of dinosaurs known as Stegosauria. • ‘Stegosaurus’ comes from the Greek words ‘stegos’ meaning roof and ‘sauros’ meaning lizard. • Stegosaurus fossils have been found in western North America and more recently in Portugal, indicating that they lived in Europe as well. • Although the Stegosaurus body was large, the size of their brain was only around the size of a dog’s. • Researchers believe that due to the nature of Stegosaurus legs, they had a maximum speed of around 7kph (5mph). • The 17 plates found along the back of the Stegosaurus arose from the skin rather than being attached to the skeleton. The largest plates were around 60cm (2ft) tall and 60cm (2ft) wide. • The Stegosaurus also featured tail spikes that reached around 60cm (2ft) to 90cm (3ft) in length.
PTERANODON [Winged and toothless]	H: 1.8 m - 6 ft.	W: 7.8-8 m - 25-33 ft.	35 pounds (15.8 kg)	Primarily fish	Gretageous 68-65 68-65 Million years	• Pteranodon was a flying reptile • It was not a dinosaur, but was a close relative of the dinosaurs. • Pteranodon's wing-span is longer than that of any known bird. • It had a crest on its head, no teeth at all, and a very short tail. • They had big brains and excellent eyesight. • Pteranodon wings were roofed by a leathery membrane. • Some pteranodons had long, light-weight, bony crests on their heads that may have acted as a helm or stabilizer when flying, or may have been a sexual trait. They had no teeth.
